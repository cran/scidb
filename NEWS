CHANGES IN scidb 1.1-0:

  SIGNIFICANT BUG FIX:

    o Materializing subsetting operations could return inconsistently ordered data when
      results spanned SciDB array chunks across multiple SciDB instances. Data are now
      returned correctly in such cases.

  OTHER BUG FIXES:

    o Fixed a bug in the processing of the start argument in the as.scidb function.

    o Fixed several bugs in the image function.

  NEW FEATURES:

    o The iquery function now accepts n=Inf to efficiently download all output
      from query at once. The iterative=TRUE option should still be used with
      smaller n values to iterate over large results.

    o The crossprod and tcrossprod functions are now available for SciDB arrays
      and mixed SciDB/R objects.
      
    o A diag function is now available for SciDB matrices, returning result as a new
      SciDB 1-D array (vector).

    o Element-wise exponentiation was implemented for scidb array objects.

    o Implemented a sum function for scidb array objects.
