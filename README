Thanks for trying out the SciDB package for R. I hope you enjoy using it.

The SciDB R package requires installation of a simple open-source HTTP network
service called on the computer that SciDB is installed on. This service only
needs to be installed on the SciDB machine, not on client computers that
connect to SciDB from R.  It's available in packaged binary form for supported
SciDB operating systems, and as source code which can be compiled and deployed
on any SciDB installation.

See http://github.com/paradigm4/shim  for source code and installation
instructions.
